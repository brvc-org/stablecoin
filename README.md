# Satoshi Stablecoin

Initial idea:

$100M initial circulation, backed by Satoshi wallets

Stablecoin value: $1.39

71,942,446 initial coin supply

Potential ticker symbol: USBT


STEPS:

Draft a “BRVC Stability Policy” outlining collateral type, reserve audit frequency, governance model, and compliance strategy

Build or adopt a Proof-of-Reserve tool so users can verify backing in real-time

Define your collateral and redemption mechanics — capped supply, mint & burn formulas, risk buffers

Map out governance: e.g. multisig signers, emergency pause functions, DAO thresholds

Plan AML/KYC and compliance logistics — especially given cross‑border implications
